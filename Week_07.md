## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
- This week, I did extensive **research on database options and related dependencies**. I now have an understanding of why express-session and connect-sqlite3 are the best choices for managing sessions in our project: simple integration, allows sessions to persist across server restarts, straightforward to set up and configure, uses a session secret to sign cookies, sessions are stored on the server rather than on the client.

- I **set up backend endpoints for signup, login, and logout**, creating controllers that connect the database to frontend requests and send responses back to the client. Each login response includes session data, which is now stored in our SQLite database.

- I learned the **purpose of cookies**: session management, personalization, security, and tracking user interactions. In the frontend, setting "credentials: 'include'" and In the backend, setting "credentials: true" - ensures the session cookie is maintained across requests, allowing **persistent sessions between the client and server**. 
Frontend:
```
const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				},
				credentials: 'include',
				body: JSON.stringify(body),
			});
```
Backend:
```
app.use(cors({
  credentials: true,
}));
```

- I **configured the session store** with specific parameters for the database path, session table, and storage location. This setup helps ensure that session IDs and session data are stored persistently and in a structured way within our database.
```
store: new SQLiteStore({
      table: 'sessions',
      db: 'crafts_db',
      dir: dbPath,
  }) as session.Store,
```

- After researching security best practices, I started to incorporate **security-focused thinking** into my tasks. I opted to store sessions in the database (since database sessions can be encrypted, backed up, and securely managed), create sessions only after a verified login, and define user roles at signup for future authorization use.

- I **generated a session_secret key** using Nodeâ€™s crypto library to enhance session security. This secret key protects against session hijacking by validating session IDs, making it much harder for unauthorized users to access or alter session data.
```
app.use(session({
  store: new SQLiteStore({
      table: 'sessions',
      db: 'crafts_db',
      dir: dbPath,
  }) as session.Store,
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'fallback-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
      maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24,
      secure: false, // Set to true if you're using HTTPS in production
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'lax',
  }
}));
```

- I learned about **password hashing and its importance**. Hashing transforms passwords into complex strings, and with added salting (adding random data), it ensures each hashed password is unique and secure.
```
const hashedPass = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
// "f52fbd32b2b3b86ff88ef6c490628285f482af15ddcb29541f94bcf526a3f6c7"
```

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
-  I initially **struggled with defining the session store** in our database. I relied on documentation without fully understanding how to adapt it to our setup. After finding a useful GitHub article, I was able to configure it correctly by setting the dir path, database name, and session table explicitly.
```
store: new SQLiteStore({
      table: 'sessions',
      db: 'crafts_db',
      dir: dbPath,
  }) as session.Store,
```
